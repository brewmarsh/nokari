## Current Refactoring Task: Asynchronous Resume Analysis

**Objective:** Fix the performance bottleneck in the `JobPostingView` by moving the confidence score calculation to an asynchronous background task.

**Design:**

The current implementation calculates job-resume matching scores on-the-fly every time the `/api/jobs/` endpoint is called. This is inefficient. The new design will calculate these scores only when a user's resume changes.

1.  A new Celery task, `analyze_resume_against_jobs`, will be created. This task will take a user ID as an argument.
2.  Inside the task, it will retrieve the user's latest resume and all `JobPosting` objects.
3.  It will then iterate through all jobs, calculate the confidence score for each, and update the `confidence_score` field on the `JobPosting` model. *Note: This is still not perfectly optimal, as it recalculates for all jobs for one user. A more advanced implementation might use a join table to store user-specific scores, but for now, updating the job posting directly is a significant improvement and simpler to implement.*
4.  The `ResumeView` (for resume creation/update) will be modified to trigger this Celery task whenever a user uploads or changes their resume.
5.  The `JobPostingView` will be simplified to remove the on-the-fly calculation entirely. It will just serialize the `JobPosting` objects with their already-calculated scores.

### Detailed Implementation Plan for Coding Agent:

1.  **Create New Celery Task:**
    *   In `app/core/tasks.py`, define a new shared task: `@shared_task def analyze_resume_against_jobs(user_id):`.
    *   Inside this task:
        *   Import `get_user_model`, `JobPosting`, and `Resume`.
        *   Fetch the `User` object using the `user_id`.
        *   Fetch the user's most recent `Resume`. If none exists, log a message and exit the task.
        *   Fetch all `JobPosting` objects.
        *   Read the content of the resume file.
        *   *Crucially, the `match_resume` function is still missing from the codebase*. For this step, we will **mock the matching logic**. You will need to define a placeholder function, e.g., `def placeholder_match_resume(resume_text, job_description): return {'scores': [0.5]}` and use that. This allows us to build the pipeline without having the real ML logic.
        *   Loop through each `JobPosting`, call the placeholder matching function, and update `job_posting.confidence_score`.
        *   Use `JobPosting.objects.bulk_update()` to save all the changes in an efficient query.

2.  **Modify `ResumeView`:**
    *   In `app/core/views.py`, locate the `ResumeView`.
    *   In the `perform_create` method (which is called on new resume uploads), after `serializer.save(user=self.request.user)`, add a call to the new Celery task: `analyze_resume_against_jobs.delay(self.request.user.id)`.
    *   Similarly, for the `ResumeDetailView`, in the `perform_update` method, add the same Celery task call.

3.  **Clean up `JobPostingView`:**
    *   In `app/core/views.py`, find the `JobPostingView`.
    *   Remove the entire block of code that starts with `resume = Resume.objects.filter(user=self.request.user).first()`. This is the code that performs the slow, on-the-fly calculation.

4.  **Submit for Review:**
    *   Commit the changes to a new branch.

## Backend Refactoring Details

### 1. Critical Bug: Missing `match_resume` Function

*   **Issue:** The `JobPostingView` in `app/core/views.py` calls a function `match_resume` that is not defined or imported, which will cause the application to crash.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Locate the intended `match_resume` function or implement it if it was never written. Given its name, it's likely a text-matching or ML function.
    *   If the feature is not ready, comment out the code that calls it to prevent crashes.

### 2. Performance: Inefficient `JobPostingView`

*   **Issue:** The `JobPostingView` calculates a `confidence_score` for every job on every request. This is highly inefficient and will lead to slow response times and high database load.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Move the `confidence_score` calculation to an asynchronous background task.
    *   The calculation should be triggered when a user's resume is uploaded or updated, or when a new job is scraped, not during a `GET` request.

### 3. Modularity and Duplication

*   **Issue:**
    *   Scraping logic is duplicated in `ScrapeView` and the `scrape_in_background` function in `app/core/views.py`.
    *   The `generate_embedding` function is located in `views.py`, but it's a utility function.
    *   The `sentence-transformers` model is loaded at the module level in `views.py`, impacting startup time and modularity.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Create a new module `app/core/scraping_logic.py` and move all scraping-related functions into it.
    *   Create a new module `app/core/ml_utils.py` and move `generate_embedding` and the model loading logic into it. The model should be loaded on demand if possible.

### 4. Reliability

*   **Issue:**
    *   Background tasks are run using Python's `threading` module, which is not ideal for a production Django application.
    *   Exception handling in the scraper is too broad (`except Exception as e:`).
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Replace `threading` with a proper task queue like Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ.
    *   Use more specific exception handling in the scraper to provide better error logging and debugging.

### 5. Security

*   **Issue:** The `UserSerializer` allows creating superusers via an API endpoint.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove this functionality. Superuser creation should be handled exclusively through the `createsuperuser` management command.

### 6. Code Cleanliness

*   **Issue:**
    *   The `test_page` view in `app/core/views.py` appears to be unused.
    *   There is a duplicate `numpy` import in `app/core/views.py`.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Remove the `test_page` view and its corresponding URL pattern.
    *   Remove the duplicate import.

## Frontend Refactoring

### 1. Component Architecture

*   **Issue:** The `Jobs.jsx` component is a large, monolithic component that handles too much state and logic.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Break down `Jobs.jsx` into smaller, more manageable components. For example, create a `JobCard.jsx`, `JobFilters.jsx`, and `ActionMenu.jsx`.
    *   Consider using a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit to manage shared state, especially if the application is expected to grow.

### 2. Code Duplication and Style

*   **Issue:**
    *   SVG icons are defined as components directly within `Jobs.jsx`, and the `HideIcon` is duplicated.
    *   There is a heavy reliance on inline styles.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Move SVG icon components to their own files in a `components/icons` directory.
    *   Move all inline styles to their corresponding CSS files (`Jobs.css`, etc.) to improve maintainability and reusability.

### 3. API and State Management

*   **Issue:**
    *   The `axios` configuration in `services/api.js` has some duplication.
    *   Some UI updates (like pinning a job) trigger a full refetch of all jobs, which is inefficient.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Refactor the `axios` configuration to avoid duplication.
    *   Implement optimistic UI updates for actions like pinning, hiding, etc. The UI should update immediately, and then be reverted if the API call fails.

### 4. Code Cleanliness

*   **Issue:** There are numerous `console.log` statements throughout the code.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove `console.log` statements or replace them with a proper logging framework for production builds.

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### 1. Scraper Reliability

*   **Issue:** The scraper relies on heuristics to parse information from Google search results, which is fragile and can break if the structure of the search results changes.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   For each `ScrapableDomain`, investigate if they provide a more direct API for job postings.
    *   Implement more robust parsing logic with better error handling and logging to identify when a scraper for a specific domain breaks.
