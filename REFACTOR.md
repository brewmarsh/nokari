## Current Refactoring Task: Frontend Component Refactoring

**Objective:** Improve the modularity, maintainability, and reusability of the frontend code by breaking down the monolithic `Jobs.jsx` component.

**Design:**

The `Jobs.jsx` component will be refactored into a container component that manages state and data fetching, and several smaller, presentational components that handle specific parts of the UI.

1.  **`Jobs.jsx` (Container):** Will continue to manage the state for jobs, filters, and loading states. It will fetch data from the API and pass down the necessary data and callbacks to its children.
2.  **`JobFilters.jsx` (Presentational):** Will receive the filter values and `onChange` handlers as props. It will be responsible for rendering the input fields for title, company, and keyword search.
3.  **`JobCard.jsx` (Presentational):** Will receive a single `job` object as a prop and be responsible for rendering the entire job card, including the header, description, and footer. This will make the main job list easier to read and manage.
4.  **`ActionMenu.jsx` (Presentational):** Will receive the `job` object and the various action handlers (`onHide`, `onHideCompany`, `onFindSimilar`) as props. It will render the three-dots menu and its dropdown.
5.  **Icon Components:** All inline SVG icons (`ThreeDotsIcon`, `RemoteIcon`, `HideIcon`) will be moved to a new directory `frontend/src/components/icons/`. Each icon will be in its own file (e.g., `ThreeDotsIcon.jsx`). This will remove duplicated code and make the icons reusable throughout the application.

### Detailed Implementation Plan for Coding Agent:

This refactoring will be done in small, incremental steps.

1.  **Create Icon Components:**
    *   Create a new directory: `frontend/src/components/icons`.
    *   For each icon in `Jobs.jsx` (`ThreeDotsIcon`, `RemoteIcon`, `HideIcon`), create a new component file in the `icons` directory (e.g., `frontend/src/components/icons/ThreeDotsIcon.jsx`).
    *   Move the SVG code into the new component files.
    *   Update `Jobs.jsx` to import these new icon components.
    *   Commit this change.

2.  **Create `JobCard.jsx` Component:**
    *   Create a new file: `frontend/src/components/JobCard.jsx`.
    *   Move the JSX for rendering a single job card from `Jobs.jsx` into `JobCard.jsx`.
    *   The new component will accept a `job` object and action handlers (e.g., `onPin`, `onHide`, etc.) as props.
    *   Update `Jobs.jsx` to import and use the new `JobCard` component within its `.map()` loop.
    *   Commit this change.

3.  **Refactor `Jobs.jsx` and Submit:**
    *   At this point, the `Jobs.jsx` file will be significantly smaller. The remaining logic for filtering, data fetching, and state management will remain in `Jobs.jsx`.
    *   (Optional, can be a separate step) The `JobFilters` and `ActionMenu` can also be extracted as described in the design, but the biggest improvement will come from extracting the `JobCard`.
    *   Submit the final, refactored code for review.

## Backend Refactoring Details

### 1. Critical Bug: Missing `match_resume` Function

*   **Issue:** The `JobPostingView` in `app/core/views.py` calls a function `match_resume` that is not defined or imported, which will cause the application to crash.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Locate the intended `match_resume` function or implement it if it was never written. Given its name, it's likely a text-matching or ML function.
    *   If the feature is not ready, comment out the code that calls it to prevent crashes.

### 2. Performance: Inefficient `JobPostingView`

*   **Issue:** The `JobPostingView` calculates a `confidence_score` for every job on every request. This is highly inefficient and will lead to slow response times and high database load.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Move the `confidence_score` calculation to an asynchronous background task.
    *   The calculation should be triggered when a user's resume is uploaded or updated, or when a new job is scraped, not during a `GET` request.

### 3. Modularity and Duplication

*   **Issue:**
    *   Scraping logic is duplicated in `ScrapeView` and the `scrape_in_background` function in `app/core/views.py`.
    *   The `generate_embedding` function is located in `views.py`, but it's a utility function.
    *   The `sentence-transformers` model is loaded at the module level in `views.py`, impacting startup time and modularity.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Create a new module `app/core/scraping_logic.py` and move all scraping-related functions into it.
    *   Create a new module `app/core/ml_utils.py` and move `generate_embedding` and the model loading logic into it. The model should be loaded on demand if possible.

### 4. Reliability

*   **Issue:**
    *   Background tasks are run using Python's `threading` module, which is not ideal for a production Django application.
    *   Exception handling in the scraper is too broad (`except Exception as e:`).
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Replace `threading` with a proper task queue like Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ.
    *   Use more specific exception handling in the scraper to provide better error logging and debugging.

### 5. Security

*   **Issue:** The `UserSerializer` allows creating superusers via an API endpoint.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove this functionality. Superuser creation should be handled exclusively through the `createsuperuser` management command.

### 6. Code Cleanliness

*   **Issue:**
    *   The `test_page` view in `app/core/views.py` appears to be unused.
    *   There is a duplicate `numpy` import in `app/core/views.py`.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Remove the `test_page` view and its corresponding URL pattern.
    *   Remove the duplicate import.

## Frontend Refactoring

### 1. Component Architecture

*   **Issue:** The `Jobs.jsx` component is a large, monolithic component that handles too much state and logic.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Break down `Jobs.jsx` into smaller, more manageable components. For example, create a `JobCard.jsx`, `JobFilters.jsx`, and `ActionMenu.jsx`.
    *   Consider using a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit to manage shared state, especially if the application is expected to grow.

### 2. Code Duplication and Style

*   **Issue:**
    *   SVG icons are defined as components directly within `Jobs.jsx`, and the `HideIcon` is duplicated.
    *   There is a heavy reliance on inline styles.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Move SVG icon components to their own files in a `components/icons` directory.
    *   Move all inline styles to their corresponding CSS files (`Jobs.css`, etc.) to improve maintainability and reusability.

### 3. API and State Management

*   **Issue:**
    *   The `axios` configuration in `services/api.js` has some duplication.
    *   Some UI updates (like pinning a job) trigger a full refetch of all jobs, which is inefficient.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Refactor the `axios` configuration to avoid duplication.
    *   Implement optimistic UI updates for actions like pinning, hiding, etc. The UI should update immediately, and then be reverted if the API call fails.

### 4. Code Cleanliness

*   **Issue:** There are numerous `console.log` statements throughout the code.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove `console.log` statements or replace them with a proper logging framework for production builds.

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### 1. Scraper Reliability

*   **Issue:** The scraper relies on heuristics to parse information from Google search results, which is fragile and can break if the structure of the search results changes.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   For each `ScrapableDomain`, investigate if they provide a more direct API for job postings.
    *   Implement more robust parsing logic with better error handling and logging to identify when a scraper for a specific domain breaks.
