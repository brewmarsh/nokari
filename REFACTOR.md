## Current Refactoring Task: Frontend Cleanup and Advanced Scraping

This phase of the refactoring has two main goals:
1.  Finish cleaning up the frontend components and code.
2.  Implement a more advanced and reliable scraping mechanism.

### Phase 1: Frontend Cleanup

**Objective:** To finish the process of breaking down monolithic components and cleaning up the frontend codebase.

**Detailed Implementation Plan (in small chunks):**

1.  **Extract `JobFilters.jsx` Component:**
    *   Create a new file: `frontend/src/components/JobFilters.jsx`.
    *   Move the filter input fields (`title`, `company`, `search`) and the "Show/Hide Filters" button from `Jobs.jsx` into this new component.
    *   The state for the filter values will remain in `Jobs.jsx` for now, and the values and `onChange` handlers will be passed down as props.
    *   Commit this change.

2.  **Refactor `api.js` Service:**
    *   In `frontend/src/services/api.js`, the `axios` configuration for `baseURL` and `headers` is duplicated.
    *   Refactor this to define a common configuration object and reuse it for both the authenticated (`api`) and unauthenticated (`api_unauthenticated`) instances.
    *   Commit this change.

3.  **Remove `console.log` Statements:**
    *   Perform a codebase-wide search for `console.log()` statements in the `frontend/` directory.
    *   Remove all of them to clean up the code for a production environment.
    *   Commit this change.

### Phase 2: Advanced Scraping Refactor

**Objective:** To improve the quality and reliability of the scraped job data by fetching and parsing content directly from the job posting URLs.

**Detailed Implementation Plan (in small chunks):**

4.  **Enhance Scraping with Direct, Detailed Fetching:**
    *   Modify the `scrape_jobs` function in `app/core/scraping_logic.py`.
    *   After getting the initial list of jobs from the Google API, loop through each job.
    *   For each job, use the `requests` library to fetch the HTML from the `job['link']`.
    *   Use the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML.
    *   Implement a generic parsing strategy to find and extract the following details from the parsed HTML:
        *   **Job Title:** Look for `<h1>`, `<h2>`, or the `<title>` tag.
        *   **Company Name:** Often found near the title or in the page's metadata.
        *   **Location:** Search for text near keywords like "Location", "Located", etc.
        *   **Work Arrangement:** Scan the text for "remote", "hybrid", "onsite".
        *   **Posting Date:** Search for text near "Posted", or look for `<time>` elements.
        *   **Full Description:** Attempt to find the main content block of the page (e.g., `<div id="job-description">`, `<main>`, `article`).
    *   The data extracted from the page will overwrite the initial, less reliable data from the Google API.
    *   Wrap this entire process in a `try...except` block to gracefully handle network errors, timeouts, or parsing failures for any given URL.
    *   Commit this enhanced scraping logic.

5.  **Verify Database Model:**
    *   Review the `JobPosting` model in `app/core/models.py`.
    *   Confirm that the `description` field is a `TextField` and that other fields are appropriate for the detailed data we will be scraping.
    *   If any model changes are necessary, create a new migration file. (Based on current knowledge, no changes are expected, but this is a verification step).
    *   Commit any necessary model or migration changes.

## Backend Refactoring Details

### 1. Critical Bug: Missing `match_resume` Function

*   **Issue:** The `JobPostingView` in `app/core/views.py` calls a function `match_resume` that is not defined or imported, which will cause the application to crash.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Locate the intended `match_resume` function or implement it if it was never written. Given its name, it's likely a text-matching or ML function.
    *   If the feature is not ready, comment out the code that calls it to prevent crashes.

### 2. Performance: Inefficient `JobPostingView`

*   **Issue:** The `JobPostingView` calculates a `confidence_score` for every job on every request. This is highly inefficient and will lead to slow response times and high database load.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Move the `confidence_score` calculation to an asynchronous background task.
    *   The calculation should be triggered when a user's resume is uploaded or updated, or when a new job is scraped, not during a `GET` request.

### 3. Modularity and Duplication

*   **Issue:**
    *   Scraping logic is duplicated in `ScrapeView` and the `scrape_in_background` function in `app/core/views.py`.
    *   The `generate_embedding` function is located in `views.py`, but it's a utility function.
    *   The `sentence-transformers` model is loaded at the module level in `views.py`, impacting startup time and modularity.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Create a new module `app/core/scraping_logic.py` and move all scraping-related functions into it.
    *   Create a new module `app/core/ml_utils.py` and move `generate_embedding` and the model loading logic into it. The model should be loaded on demand if possible.

### 4. Reliability

*   **Issue:**
    *   Background tasks are run using Python's `threading` module, which is not ideal for a production Django application.
    *   Exception handling in the scraper is too broad (`except Exception as e:`).
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Replace `threading` with a proper task queue like Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ.
    *   Use more specific exception handling in the scraper to provide better error logging and debugging.

### 5. Security

*   **Issue:** The `UserSerializer` allows creating superusers via an API endpoint.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove this functionality. Superuser creation should be handled exclusively through the `createsuperuser` management command.

### 6. Code Cleanliness

*   **Issue:**
    *   The `test_page` view in `app/core/views.py` appears to be unused.
    *   There is a duplicate `numpy` import in `app/core/views.py`.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Remove the `test_page` view and its corresponding URL pattern.
    *   Remove the duplicate import.

## Frontend Refactoring

### 1. Component Architecture

*   **Issue:** The `Jobs.jsx` component is a large, monolithic component that handles too much state and logic.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Break down `Jobs.jsx` into smaller, more manageable components. For example, create a `JobCard.jsx`, `JobFilters.jsx`, and `ActionMenu.jsx`.
    *   Consider using a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit to manage shared state, especially if the application is expected to grow.

### 2. Code Duplication and Style

*   **Issue:**
    *   SVG icons are defined as components directly within `Jobs.jsx`, and the `HideIcon` is duplicated.
    *   There is a heavy reliance on inline styles.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Move SVG icon components to their own files in a `components/icons` directory.
    *   Move all inline styles to their corresponding CSS files (`Jobs.css`, etc.) to improve maintainability and reusability.

### 3. API and State Management

*   **Issue:**
    *   The `axios` configuration in `services/api.js` has some duplication.
    *   Some UI updates (like pinning a job) trigger a full refetch of all jobs, which is inefficient.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Refactor the `axios` configuration to avoid duplication.
    *   Implement optimistic UI updates for actions like pinning, hiding, etc. The UI should update immediately, and then be reverted if the API call fails.

### 4. Code Cleanliness

*   **Issue:** There are numerous `console.log` statements throughout the code.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove `console.log` statements or replace them with a proper logging framework for production builds.

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### 1. Scraper Reliability

*   **Issue:** The scraper relies on heuristics to parse information from Google search results, which is fragile and can break if the structure of the search results changes.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   For each `ScrapableDomain`, investigate if they provide a more direct API for job postings.
    *   Implement more robust parsing logic with better error handling and logging to identify when a scraper for a specific domain breaks.
