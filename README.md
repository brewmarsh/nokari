# Nokari Job Scraper

Nokari is a web application designed to scrape job postings from various sources, helping users to find relevant job opportunities efficiently. It features a Django backend and a React frontend.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nokari.git
    cd nokari
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    You will need to fill in the required environment variables in this file. See the Configuration section below for more details.

3.  **Build and run the application using Docker Compose:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables, which are defined in the `.env` file.

### Google API Credentials

To enable the job scraping functionality, you need to obtain a Google API Key and a Custom Search Engine ID.

#### How to get a Google API Key:

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project or select an existing one.
3.  From the navigation menu, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
4.  Click on **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **API key**.
5.  Your new API key will be created. Copy this key.
6.  It is highly recommended to restrict your API key to prevent unauthorized use. You can restrict it to the **Custom Search API**.
7.  Add the API key to your `.env` file:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

#### How to get a Custom Search Engine ID:

1.  Go to the [Programmable Search Engine control panel](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all).
2.  Click **Add** to create a new search engine.
3.  Give your search engine a name.
4.  In the "What to search?" section, you can specify the sites you want to search. For this application, you will be providing the sites via the UI, so you can enter a placeholder like `www.google.com` for now. You can also choose to "Search the entire web".
5.  Click **Create**.
6.  After creation, go to the **Basics** tab of your search engine's control panel.
7.  Copy the **Search engine ID**.
8.  Add the Search Engine ID to your `.env` file:
    ```
    CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_search_engine_id_here
    ```
9.  **Important**: Make sure "Search the entire web" is turned **ON** in your search engine's setup tab. This is required for the `site:` search operator to work correctly.

## Deployment

This project is configured for continuous deployment to a Hostinger VPS using GitHub Actions.

### How it Works

When code is pushed to the `main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered. This workflow performs the following steps:

1.  **Builds Docker Images**: It builds the backend and frontend Docker images.
2.  **Pushes to Docker Hub**: The newly built images are pushed to Docker Hub.
3.  **Deploys to VPS**: The workflow then connects to the Hostinger VPS via SSH and runs a deployment script. This script pulls the latest images from Docker Hub and restarts the application services using `docker-compose`.

### Server Setup

Before the first deployment, you need to set up the `.env` file on your production server.

1.  SSH into your VPS:
    ```sh
    ssh your_vps_user@your_vps_ip
    ```
2.  Create the application directory (replace `your_vps_user` with your actual username):
    ```sh
    mkdir -p /home/your_vps_user/nokari-app
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the application directory:
    ```sh
    nano /home/your_vps_user/nokari-app/.env
    ```
4.  Add the necessary environment variables to this file. You can use the `.env.example` file as a reference. Make sure to set the production values for your database, API keys, and other secrets.

### Triggering a Deployment

To deploy a new version of the application, simply push your changes to the `main` branch. The GitHub Actions workflow will handle the rest.

### Manual Deployment

While deployment is automated, you can manually trigger the deployment script on the server if needed.

1.  SSH into your VPS:
    ```sh
    ssh your_user@your_vps_ip
    ```
2.  Navigate to the application directory:
    ```sh
    cd /home/user/nokari-app
    ```
3.  Run the deployment script:
    ```sh
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
